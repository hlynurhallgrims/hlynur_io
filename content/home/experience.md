Data scientist, R-developer and economist working within the Department of Taxation. My work focuses on revenue forecasting via microsimulation and machine learning in R and SQL. 

I'm also the creator and maintainer of some pretty neat things, such as the Ministry's Tax-Benefit Microsimulation Model and the Ministry's internal R package, as well as some rather fancy R-Shiny dashboards and interactive reports.

  In February of 2015 I started an 8-month, paid graduate-level internship at the Federation of Icelandic Industries (SI). During that time I worked on some wonderfully diverse tasks; economic analysis, tax modeling, and web analytics to name a few. 
  
  Upon graduation I returned to SI as a Data Analyst within the division of High-tech and IP-intensive industries. As an analyst my job was to work with member organizations - where 'the domain specific knowledge lived' - and further translate that knowledge into actionable insights through collecting, aggregating and analyzing data, as well as communicating those insights to stakeholders through reports and briefing notes.
